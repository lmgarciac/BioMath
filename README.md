# Microgame WIP (OpenGL)

Work-in-progress **microgame** built from scratch using raw Win32 + OpenGL, with no engines or helper libraries. The goal of this project is to learn by doing: understanding the graphics stack, building procedural visuals and systems, and iteratively evolving a minimal interactive prototype into a small but complete game. This repository is a hands-on learning space, not a finished product.
